I'm Winslow Young, Director of AI & Digital Strategy at Young Automotive Group. I spend my days building automation systems, managing ad campaigns, and figuring out how to make AI actually useful for real business problems. I'm not here to sell you on some grand vision of the future—I just want a place to share what I'm working on and connect with people who are tackling similar challenges.

The truth is, I'm still learning all of this. Every week brings new tools, new problems, and new ways of thinking about automation and AI. Writing about what I'm discovering helps me process it, and if sharing that journey helps someone else avoid a mistake I made or speeds up their own work, that's even better. This blog is as much for me as it is for anyone reading it.
