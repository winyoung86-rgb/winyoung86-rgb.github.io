I'm Winslow Young, Director of AI & Digital Strategy at Young Automotive Group. I spend my days building automation systems, managing ad campaigns, and figuring out how to make AI actually useful for real business problems. I'm not here to sell you on some grand vision of the future—I just want a place to share what I'm working on and connect with people who are tackling similar challenges.

## What I'll Be Writing About

I work at the intersection of AI, automation, and automotive marketing. That means my posts will cover things like building [n8n](https://n8n.io) workflows that handle thousands of ad variations, using [Claude](https://claude.ai) and [Gemini](https://ai.google.dev/) to solve real business problems, wiring up [Supabase](https://supabase.com) databases to power internal tools, and the occasional deep dive into what's actually working (and what isn't) in AI-powered marketing.

I'm also learning full-stack development in real time — going from Google Sheets and Apps Script to building actual web applications. Expect some honest posts about that journey too.

## Who This Is For

If you're a marketing professional curious about AI, a business leader trying to figure out where automation fits, or a fellow tinkerer who spends too many late nights building things — this is for you. I'm not writing for engineers or AI researchers. I'm writing for people like me who came from a non-technical background and are figuring this out as they go.

## Why Write It Down

The truth is, I'm still learning all of this. Every week brings new tools, new problems, and new ways of thinking about automation and AI. Writing about what I'm discovering helps me process it, and if sharing that journey helps someone else avoid a mistake I made or speeds up their own work, that's even better. This blog is as much for me as it is for anyone reading it.

## What's Coming

I've got posts planned about my [AI rabbit hole](/blog/posts/2026-02-15-my-ai-rabbit-hole/) — how I went from zero to building full backend systems in five months. I'll share breakdowns of the automation tools I've built, lessons from managing $250K+ in monthly ad spend with AI, and honest takes on what works and what doesn't. No fluff, no hype — just real experience from someone in the trenches.
